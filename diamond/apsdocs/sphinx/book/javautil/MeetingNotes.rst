Notes
-----

There is not a firm list of requirements, the objective is to build a
data repository that includes data from SAP and Dymax that can be
expanded as new requirements arise, either from being conceived in-house
or drive by customer requirements.

No changes to SAP or Dymax are anticipated. Current systems will be used
to execute purchases,sales and warehouse operations.

Essentially, this is an *evergreen* *Decision Support* and *Business
Intelligence* repository with associated business logic. It is
*evergreen* in the sense that it is forever subject to enhancement.

Next steps
----------

Extract data from SAP and Dymax to support a Global Inventory
Optimization Strategy.

Define the initial functionality.

Follow-up
---------
