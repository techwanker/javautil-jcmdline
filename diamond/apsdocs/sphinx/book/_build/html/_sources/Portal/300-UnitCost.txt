Unit Cost
=========


During one of my calls with Peter he told me that he was reviewing
purchase orders a simple line such as "Buyers don''t buy the correct
quantities to get a good price" was extended to:

Compute Optimal Purchase Quantity
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Cost Types
~~~~~~~~~~

Compute a projected per unit cost by solving the equation

unit\_cost = (setup\_cost / qty) + incremental cost

For two different known qty and prices (vendor quotes) using linear
algebra

Graph this relationship
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Find the "price knee" the first derivative of the function, the slope of
the tangent starts to level off (it asymptotically approaches 0, meaning
the limit is the unit cost doesn''t decrease at all. Depending on setup
cost, incremental cost and annual consumption a three year supply may be
ten percent more than a one year supply, it may also be three times the
acquisition cost and additional carrying costs must be considered.

Vendor quotes should include this range of quantities, purchasing
quantities should be in this range, buys can be made and even scheduled
so that lower per unit costs can be realized.
