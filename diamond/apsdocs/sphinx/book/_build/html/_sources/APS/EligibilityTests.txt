Eligibility Tests
=================


Generally elibility tests may be considered as filters, that is, the
order of the tests is inconsequential and each test may exclude the
supply as being applicable for the demand. On occassion two or more
tests may exhibit characteristics such that the qualification of either
test is sufficient. Consider the case of buyback inventory in which
inventory has been purchased from an airframe manufacturer but
traceability to the ultimate source is not available. The airframe
manufacturer may state that if the inventory was procured from the
manufacturer under certain conditions those parts may bypass
requirements that would otherwise be in place. It is the responsibility
of the kitting or JIT provider to provide traceability back to the
airframe manufacturer without any bearing any responsibility for
ultimate traceability.
