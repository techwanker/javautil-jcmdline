<p>shipped,

before
| the newer ones. Supply prioritization changes the FIFO order for parts
| based on the settings in the Parts Master. Parts with a shelf life can
| be consumed based on the Manufacture Date or on the Expiration Date of
| the lots. Supply Prioritization also automatically relaxes all the
| constraints on the demand when allocating consignment or buyback
supply
| to a demand. Buyback and consignment supply is stock received from the
| customer that is shipped back to them when they need it. This stock is
| always deemed to meet customer requirements.</p>
