<h1>Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>The Diamond Advanced Planning System (APS) is the most feature-rich
inventory planning system in the market today. There is no other
planning engine out there that can match the Diamond APS in terms of
speed and versatility.</p>
<p>Diamond was custom designed to address the rigorous specifications of
the Aerospace industry, which imposes significantly tighter controls and
tracking functionality than a normal distribution environment and has numerous
other constraints uniquely solved by Diamond APS.</p>
<p>Diamond Advanced Planning is a module that associates demand for product
with inventory that satisfies the demand according to pluggable
(“extensible”) filters.</p>
<p>Although it was designed explicitly to accomodate the requirements of
aerospace subsets of its features will readily support virtually any
distribution, MRO or discrete manufacturing environment.</p>
<p>Diamond Advanced Planning was first written in 1983 by the author of
this document and served well in planning for Fine China and giftware.
Same was employed for a clothing manufacturer and subsequently for
Tri-Star Aerospace. In 2001 a total rewrite was effected written in Java
accommodating Aerospace requirements in version 10 of Diamond.</p>
<div class="section" id="demand-types">
<h2>Demand Types<a class="headerlink" href="#demand-types" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Supports multiple types of Demand. Demand types supported are</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Firm Customer Order</li>
<li>Work Orders and (Components of Work Orders)</li>
<li>Safety Stock</li>
<li>Forecast</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="supply-types">
<h2>Supply Types<a class="headerlink" href="#supply-types" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Supports multiple types of Supply:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>On-Hand at Location</li>
<li>In-Transit from another Location</li>
<li>Purchase Orders</li>
<li>Work Orders</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="eligible-supply-rules">
<h2>Eligible Supply Rules<a class="headerlink" href="#eligible-supply-rules" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Diamond APS is very flexible with respect to filtering supply that is eligible to meet demand.</p>
<p>Many filters are supplied and others may be added by writing a new one that complies with the
EligibleSupplyFilter interface.  New filters are &#8220;wired in&#8221; and existing code is not touched.</p>
<p>This allows for customization and rigorous testing of the customization with no risk associated with
changes to the base code or precluding update support.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="supply-partitioning">
<h2>Supply Partitioning<a class="headerlink" href="#supply-partitioning" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Physical segregation of Inventory is done using facilities.</p>
<p>Logical Segregation of Inventory within a facility is done using Supply
Pools.</p>
<p>Sourcing rules attached to every demand specify which supply to consume
and the order in which to consume.</p>
<p>The most commonly used database entities are cached in memory. Cached
entities include Facilities, Supply Pools, Sourcing Rules,
Certifications, Business Calendar, Equivalent Part Numbers, Customer
specific Substitutes, Global Substitutes, Organizations, Forecast
Groups, Application Control variables and Purchase Order Equivalents.
Caching saves on the expensive operations of database access for the
most commonly used entities.</p>
<p>Triggers on cached tables signal the Planning engine to refresh those
values.</p>
<p>Part Number, substitutes and equivalents are all planned together.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="qualifying-inventory">
<h2>Qualifying Inventory<a class="headerlink" href="#qualifying-inventory" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Ability to specify the revision level required for Sales Order and
Work Order, Safety Stock and Forecast. The revision level hierarchy
setup in the Parts Master will automatically allocate a higher
revision level if the requested revision level is not available.</li>
<li>Ability to specify certification requirements for Sales Order and
Work Order and associate it with the demand.</li>
<li>Certification requirements for Safety Stock and Forecasts are picked
up from the Customer Master.</li>
<li>Each certification has a weight associated with it. APS uses
qualifying lots with the lowest weight to satisfy any demand.</li>
<li>Ability to specify the manufacturer required at the Demand level or
can specify a list of approved manufacturers at the Customer Level.
Customer List can be set to Include or Exclude approved manufacturers</li>
<li>Ability to specify Country of Origin on the Sales Orders.</li>
<li>Ability to specify “manufactured after” or “must not expire before”
date on Sales Orders for parts with a shelf life.</li>
<li>Automatically excludes expired part numbers</li>
<li>Kits can be setup in the system to not have mixed manufacturer lots
allocated to them for any single kit. APS automatically determines
the lot quantity and how many full kits it can satisfy and then
switches to the next available lot to satisfy any remaining kits.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="demand-prioritization">
<h2>Demand Prioritization<a class="headerlink" href="#demand-prioritization" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Demand Prioritization module compares every demand for a given set of
part numbers and sorts them according to a deterministic process that complies with
the EligibleSupplyPrioritizer.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="preserve-allocations">
<h2>Preserve Allocations<a class="headerlink" href="#preserve-allocations" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Once sorted, Demand Prioritization also preserves On-hand allocations to
Customer Orders and Work Orders within lead-time. All allocations to
Safety Stock are preserved. Preserving existing allocations prevents
demands that have been put in later from taking stock away from already
existing orders. Safety Stock demand is allocated to Customer Orders and
Work Orders within the same forecast groups if there is a shortage.
Forecast Demands are reduced by the quantity of open Customer Order
demands for the same month for the same forecast group, which stops over
stating of demand for a given month.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="supply-prioritization">
<h2>Supply Prioritization<a class="headerlink" href="#supply-prioritization" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Supply prioritization uses the sourcing rules to determine which
supplies to use to satisfy a given demand.</p>
<p>Different rules are applied in different scenarios.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="demand-execution-mode">
<h2>Demand Execution Mode<a class="headerlink" href="#demand-execution-mode" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>TODO describe the various modes</p>
<p>Firm customer orders may be allocated to on-hand inventory or to the latest
replenishment prior to request date.</p>
<p>Assignment to replenishments is based on vendor on time performance.</p>
<p>Once the qualifying supplies are identified, they are then sorted based on the type of the
demand and type of the supply.</p>
<p>An example for this would be to use the oldest lots
to satisfy open sales orders while using the newest possible lots to
satisfy safety stock demand.</p>
<p>Since safety stock demand is never shipped,
it blocks the newer inventory allowing the older lots to ship out before
the newer ones. Supply prioritization changes the FIFO order for parts
based on the settings in the Parts Master.</p>
<p>Parts with a shelf life can
be consumed based on the Manufacture Date or on the Expiration Date of
the lots. Supply Prioritization also automatically relaxes all the
constraints on the demand when allocating consignment or buyback supply
to a demand.</p>
<p>Buyback and consignment supply is stock received from the
customer that is shipped back to them when they need it. This stock is
always deemed to meet customer requirements.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Allocations against on-hand supply are classified as Firm or Planned
depending on if the on-hand supply is readily available in the
primary facility or if the on-hand supply is a planned facility
transfer or a processed facility transfer in transit to the primary
facility. The primary facility for a demand is identified based on
the sourcing rule used to determine the eligible supply for the
demand.</li>
<li>APS automatically creates work orders for kits. Since APS supports
multi-level Bills of Material, it creates work orders for sub-kits
and re-plans all the items recursively till all the demands for kits
have been allocated either to on-hand inventory or to a work order.</li>
<li>Purchase Orders schedules that are late are automatically padded by a
user-defined factor and pushed forward. This enables the system to
provide realistic availability dates for the demands which are
allocated to those PO schedules.</li>
<li>Automatically allocates demands to a Purchase Order if the demand is
“X” days out in the future and there is a PO Schedule coming
available “X” days before the demand is due. The value of “X” is read
in from a Control table.</li>
<li>APS will suggest a optimum reschedule date for the PO Schedules that
have allocations against demands that need to be expedited or
rescheduled to come in at a date later than the current promise date
provided by the vendor</li>
<li>APS will also suggest cancellation of PO schedules that are not
needed to meet any demand that is present in the system.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="auditing-and-traceability">
<h2>Auditing and Traceability<a class="headerlink" href="#auditing-and-traceability" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Allocation logic fully traceable. An XML log file may be created created
for each item group planned detailing each demand and all supplies,
which ones were allocated and which ones were rejected and the reason
for rejection.</p>
<p>Ability to bind a given supply to a given demand as long as the supply
is qualified for the demand. Allocations once bound are held bound
unless unbound by the user.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="aps-output">
<h2>APS Output<a class="headerlink" href="#aps-output" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The Inventory planning process is the most impacted by running Diamond
APS. The APS output is fully web-based and provides the Inventory
planners with all the information required to make sound buying
decisions. Inventory planners have the ability to lookup shortfalls by
specifying a whole range of filter conditions. Listed below are the
details of the outputs provided by Diamond APS.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="shortages">
<h2>Shortages<a class="headerlink" href="#shortages" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Diamond APS classifies shortages into the following categories</p>
<p>Demand           Unallocated     Late
&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;  &#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;     &#8212;-
Customer Orders
Work Orders
Forecast
Safety Stock</p>
<p>Customer Orders</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Unallocated Customer Orders</li>
<li>Unallocated Work Orders</li>
<li>Unallocated Safety Stock</li>
<li>Unallocated Forecasts</li>
<li>Customers Orders allocated beyond the requested date</li>
<li>Work Orders allocated beyond the requested date</li>
<li>Safety Stock allocated beyond the requested date</li>
<li>Forecasts allocated beyond the requested date</li>
</ul>
<p>Users can choose a combination of any of these shortage conditions and
then apply the following filters to narrow their search</p>
<p>Part Number Mask (A Wildcard search for a range of Part Numbers)</p>
<p>The Part Category. Normally buyers are responsible for purchasing a
certain category or categories of parts. This help narrow the results to
only the parts they are responsible for purchasing. Within Lead Time.
This restricts the output only to shortages that occur within the lead
time for a given Part Outstanding Vendor Quotes less than “X” days. This
further narrows the search and ignores the parts that have outstanding
vendor quotes that are less than “X” days old. Vendors normally take
some time to respond to quotes and this help buyers from seeing the same
parts on the list even after they have worked on it. Planning Horizon
End Date. This restricts the list of parts being shown to have shortages
only within the Date specified here Buyer. This only shows the parts the
specified buyer is responsible for buying. Customer Code. This restricts
the list of parts only to the shortages for the customer specified.
Maximum Part to display. The default is set to 100. The users can
specify any number greater than 0.</p>
<p>Once the search criteria is specified, APS will go through its planning
results and find all the part numbers that match the specified search
criteria. It will then sort them into 4 groups.</p>
<p>A Part will only appear in one of these groups, the group in which the
part has the earliest shortage. Each part then links off into a 12-month
time-phased view of the Demand and Supply outlook. The time-phased
output has columns for past due, current, 12 months starting with the
current month and a column for demands and supplies coming in beyond 12
months. This page also provides links to see the following information
The Allocation Trace Log. This file contains a complete log of the
allocation process for the part and all its substitutes and equivalents.
Provides a listing of all the supplies available to allocation and also
lists each demand followed by which supplies were allocated to it and
which supplies were not and also provides a reason for ineligible
