<h3>Pick Restore</h3>
<p>Existing allocations to onhand inventory from work orders or customer
orders that are in pick status are preserved.</p>
<p>This Mode is also used in binding allocations.</p>
<p>An allocation is bound by updating the alloc_type_id to ’R’ and
requesting the engine to bind the allocation. The alloc_type_id is
then set to ’B’ for Bound.</p>
