<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The Diamond Advanced Planning System (APS) is the most feature-rich
planning engine out there that can match the Diamond APS in terms of
speed and versatility.</p>
<p>Diamond APS is a unique combination of DRP/MRP planning and execution
that is aware</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>of engineered parts and Aerospace constraints.</p>
<p>Diamond distribution was designed to address the
supply chain planning and execution requirements of distributors.
Diamond was custom designed to address the rigorous specifications of</p>
</div></blockquote>
<dl>
<dt>the Aerospace industry, which imposes significantly tighter controls and</dt><dd><p>tracking functionality than a normal distribution environment.</p>
<p>Features Supports Synchronous and Asynchronous planning queues. Parts</p>

<h3>Demand Prioritization</h3>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Demand Prioritization module compares every demand for a given set of</div>
<div class="line">part numbers and sorts them in the following order</div>
</div>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Sales Orders</p></li>
<li><p>Work Orders</p></li>
<li><p>Safety Stock</p></li>
<li><p>Forecasts</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="preserve-allocations">
<h3>Preserve Allocations</h3>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Once prioritized, Demand Prioritization also preserves On-hand</div>
</div>
<p>allocations to
| Customer Orders and Work Orders within lead-time. All allocations to
| Safety Stock are preserved. Preserving existing allocations prevents
| demands that have been put in later from taking stock away from
already
| existing orders. Safety Stock demand is allocated to Customer Orders
and
| Work Orders within the same forecast groups if there is a shortage.
| Forecast Demands are reduced by the quantity of open Customer Order
| demands for the same month for the same forecast group, which stops
over
| stating of demand for a given month.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="supply-prioritization">
<h3>Supply Prioritization</h3>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Supply prioritization uses the sourcing rules to determine which</div>
<div class="line">supplies to use to satisfy a given demand.</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Once the qualifying supplies are identified, they are then sorted</div>
</div>
<p>based on the type of the demand and
| type of the supply.</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">An example for this would be to use the oldest lots</div>
<div class="line">to satisfy open sales orders while using the newest possible lots to</div>
<div class="line">satisfy safety stock demand. Since safety stock demand is never</div>
</div>
<p>shipped,
| it blocks the newer inventory allowing the older lots to ship out
before
| the newer ones. Supply prioritization changes the FIFO order for parts
| based on the settings in the Parts Master. Parts with a shelf life can
| be consumed based on the Manufacture Date or on the Expiration Date of
| the lots. Supply Prioritization also automatically relaxes all the
| constraints on the demand when allocating consignment or buyback
supply
| to a demand. Buyback and consignment supply is stock received from the
| customer that is shipped back to them when they need it. This stock is
| always deemed to meet customer requirements.</p>
<ul>
<li><div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Allocations against on-hand supply are classified as Firm or</div>
</div>
<p>Planned
| depending on if the on-hand supply is readily available in the
| primary facility or if the on-hand supply is a planned facility
| transfer or a processed facility transfer in transit to the primary
| facility. The primary facility for a demand is identified based on
| the sourcing rule used to determine the eligible supply for the
| demand.</p>
</li>
<li><div class="line-block">
<div class="line">APS automatically creates work orders for kits. Since APS supports</div>
<div class="line">multi-level Bills of Material, it creates work orders for sub-kits</div>
<div class="line">and re-plans all the items recursively till all the demands for</div>
</div>
<p>kits
| have been allocated either to on-hand inventory or to a work order.</p>
</li>
<li><div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Purchase Orders schedules that are late are automatically padded by</div>
<div class="line">a user-defined factor and pushed forward. This enables the system</div>

</li>
<li><div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Automatically allocates demands to a Purchase Order if the demand</div>
</div>
<p>is

| read in from a Control table.</p>
</li>
<li><div class="line-block">
<div class="line">APS will suggest a optimum reschedule date for the PO Schedules</div>
