Minimum Viable Product:

Teams are used to asking for everything they could possibly want, this
is a non-productive approach.

Features can be delivered while new features are defined.

There is no reason to stop adding adding features

Features are evaluated by the project manager based on:

-  Value of feature

-  How long it will take to define and create

-  Importance of other features

-  Cost
