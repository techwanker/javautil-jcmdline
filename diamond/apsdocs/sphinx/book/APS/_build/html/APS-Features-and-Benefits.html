<div class="line">Once prioritized, Demand Prioritization also preserves On-hand</div>
</div>
<p>allocations to
| Customer Orders and Work Orders within lead-time. All allocations to
| Safety Stock are preserved. Preserving existing allocations prevents
| demands that have been put in later from taking stock away from
already
| existing orders. Safety Stock demand is allocated to Customer Orders
and
| Work Orders within the same forecast groups if there is a shortage.
| Forecast Demands are reduced by the quantity of open Customer Order

<div class="line">An example for this would be to use the oldest lots</div>

<div class="line">satisfy safety stock demand. Since safety stock demand is never</div>
</div>
<p>shipped,
| it blocks the newer inventory allowing the older lots to ship out
before
| the newer ones. Supply prioritization changes the FIFO order for parts
| based on the settings in the Parts Master. Parts with a shelf life can
| be consumed based on the Manufacture Date or on the Expiration Date of
| the lots. Supply Prioritization also automatically relaxes all the
| constraints on the demand when allocating consignment or buyback
supply
| to a demand. Buyback and consignment supply is stock received from the
| customer that is shipped back to them when they need it. This stock is
| always deemed to meet customer requirements.</p>
