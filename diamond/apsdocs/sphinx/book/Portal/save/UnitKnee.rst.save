During one of my calls with Peter he told me that he was reviewing
purchase orders a simple line such as "Buyers don''t buy the correct
quantities to get a good price" was extended to:

Compute Optimal Purchase Quantity
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Compute a projected per unit cost by solving the equation

unit\_cost = (setup\_cost / qty) + incremental cost

For two different known qty and prices (vendor quotes) using linear
algebra

Graph this relationsihip
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Find the "price knee" the first derivative of the function, the slope of
the tangent starts to level off (it asymptotically approaches 0, meaning
the limit is the unit cost doesn''t decrease at all. Depending on setup
cost, incremental cost and annual consumption a three year supply may be
ten percent more than a one year supply, it may also be three times the
acquisition cost and additional carrying costs must be considered.

Vendor quotes should include this range of quantities, purchasing
quantities should be in this range, buys can be made and even scheduled
so that lower per unit costs can be realized.

Purchasing Procedures
---------------------

When a part needs to be replenished

#. Vendor quotes for the price range should be required.
#. Purchase amounts over a defined limit should be reviewed and
   approved.
#. Requisitions should be created in the new purchase decision
   application and once approved, be created as purchase orders in the
   execution system (Dymax and SAP).
#. Checks for any constraints including approved manufacturers should be
   simulated
#. Existing inventory carried under equivalent part numbers should be
   considered.

The opportunities for process improvement are best addressed by
evaluating your current processes and the issues your experts realize
and developing a system to address those issues.

Constraints
-----------

Your new process should:

#. Be external to SAP and Dymax, requiring no modifications to either
   system. This eliminates risk and complexity.
#. Should include data from both operations for inventory, purchases and
   demands
#. Incorporate new procedures and policies to reflect best practices
#. Reduce the effort of sales staff and purchasing staff to perform
   their functions
#. Define metrics to evaluate performance and progress
#. Have an alert system of reports of issues that need to be addressed.
#. Require no hardware or other infrastructure or the installation of
   any software on any Align computer.

Questions
=========

What is the current cost of:

#. Not buying the correct quantities
#. Not taking into consideration multiple certifications
#. Buying inventory in one operation that is excess inventory in the
   other operation
#. Time wasted gathering information to create a purchase order

Conclusion
==========

Align has the expertise in house to participate in the design of a
business process and software to optimize the purchasing and sales
operations, there is no need to wait for an IT person who has much less
experience than your director of purchasing and other operations
personnel.

A one hour phone call every two weeks is not going to ever get you a
design.

I have no doubt that several times every day a sub-optimal purchase
results in a expense greater than the cost of developing a design.

A design is best done by whiteboard meetings, starting with a blank
whiteboard. Even with 25 years experience in Aerospace, it would be
presumptious, and flat out wrong for me to give a powerpoint
presentation and say "This is the universal answer to all problems, it
will fit your situation"; this is the approach of someone hawking
software.
