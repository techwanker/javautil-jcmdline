<h1>Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>The Diamond Advanced Planning System (APS) is the most feature-rich
inventory planning system in the market today. There is no other
planning engine out there that can match the Diamond APS in terms of
speed and versatility.</p>
<p>Diamond APS is a unique combination of DRP/MRP planning and execution that is aware
of engineered parts and Aerospace constraints.</p>
<p>Diamond distribution was designed to address the
supply chain planning and execution requirements of distributors.
Diamond was custom designed to address the rigorous specifications of
the Aerospace industry, which imposes significantly tighter controls and
tracking functionality than a normal distribution environment.</p>
<p>Features Supports Synchronous and Asynchronous planning queues. Parts in
the synchronous planning queue are planned the instant they are put into
the queue. The planning engine plans parts in the asynchronous planning
queue when it reaches the top of the queue. The asynchronous planning
queue is activated every time a part is inserted into the queue.</p>

<div class="section" id="demand-prioritization">
<h2>Demand Prioritization<a class="headerlink" href="#demand-prioritization" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Demand Prioritization module compares every demand for a given set of
part numbers and sorts them in the following order</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Sales Orders</p></li>
<li><p>Work Orders</p></li>
<li><p>Safety Stock</p></li>
<li><p>Forecasts</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="preserve-allocations">
<h2>Preserve Allocations<a class="headerlink" href="#preserve-allocations" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Once prioritized, Demand Prioritization also preserves On-hand allocations to
Customer Orders and Work Orders within lead-time. All allocations to
Safety Stock are preserved. Preserving existing allocations prevents
demands that have been put in later from taking stock away from already
existing orders. Safety Stock demand is allocated to Customer Orders and
Work Orders within the same forecast groups if there is a shortage.
Forecast Demands are reduced by the quantity of open Customer Order
demands for the same month for the same forecast group, which stops over
stating of demand for a given month.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="supply-prioritization">
<h2>Supply Prioritization<a class="headerlink" href="#supply-prioritization" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Supply prioritization uses the sourcing rules to determine which
supplies to use to satisfy a given demand.</p>
<p>Once the qualifying supplies are identified, they are then sorted based on the type of the demand and
type of the supply.</p>
<p>An example for this would be to use the oldest lots
to satisfy open sales orders while using the newest possible lots to
satisfy safety stock demand. Since safety stock demand is never shipped,
it blocks the newer inventory allowing the older lots to ship out before
the newer ones. Supply prioritization changes the FIFO order for parts
based on the settings in the Parts Master. Parts with a shelf life can
be consumed based on the Manufacture Date or on the Expiration Date of
the lots. Supply Prioritization also automatically relaxes all the
constraints on the demand when allocating consignment or buyback supply
to a demand. Buyback and consignment supply is stock received from the
customer that is shipped back to them when they need it. This stock is
always deemed to meet customer requirements.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Allocations against on-hand supply are classified as Firm or Planned
depending on if the on-hand supply is readily available in the
primary facility or if the on-hand supply is a planned facility
transfer or a processed facility transfer in transit to the primary
facility. The primary facility for a demand is identified based on
the sourcing rule used to determine the eligible supply for the
demand.</p></li>
<li><p>APS automatically creates work orders for kits. Since APS supports
multi-level Bills of Material, it creates work orders for sub-kits
and re-plans all the items recursively till all the demands for kits
have been allocated either to on-hand inventory or to a work order.</p></li>
<li><p>Purchase Orders schedules that are late are automatically padded by
a user-defined factor and pushed forward. This enables the system to
provide realistic availability dates for the demands which are
allocated to those PO schedules.</p></li>
<li><p>Automatically allocates demands to a Purchase Order if the demand is
“X” days out in the future and there is a PO Schedule coming
available “X” days before the demand is due. The value of “X” is
read in from a Control table.</p></li>
<li><p>APS will suggest a optimum reschedule date for the PO Schedules that
have allocations against demands that need to be expedited or
rescheduled to come in at a date later than the current promise date
provided by the vendor</p></li>
<li><p>APS will also suggest cancellation of PO schedules that are not
needed to meet any demand that is present in the system.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Allocation logic fully traceable. An XML or JSON log file may be created created
for each item group planned detailing each demand and all supplies,
which ones were allocated and which ones were rejected and the reason
for rejection.</p>
<p>Ability to bind a given supply to a given demand as long as the supply
is qualified for the demand. Allocations once bound are held bound
unless unbound by the user.</p>

<h2>APS Output<a class="headerlink" href="#aps-output" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The Inventory planning process is the most affect by running Diamond
APS. The APS output is fully web-based and provides the Inventory
planners with all the information required to make sound buying
decisions. Inventory planners have the ability to lookup shortfalls by
specifying a whole range of filter conditions. Listed below are the
details of the outputs provided by Diamond APS.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="projected-inventory-position">
<h2>Projected Inventory Position<a class="headerlink" href="#projected-inventory-position" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><em>PIP</em> Projected Inventory Position.</p>
<p>Each supply has an <em>available date</em></p>
<p>For on-hand inventory that is the current date or the <em>effective date</em> in case of some
simulations.</p>
<p>For purchase orders that is the <em>current promise date</em>.</p>
<p>For work orders that is the <em>need by date</em>.</p>
<p>A timeline is created by generating <em>buckets</em>, typically calendar months.</p>
<p>Each supply has its own PIP, which is strictly decreasing.  Allocations of demand are bucketed based on <em>current promise date</em>
or the associated supply <em>available date</em>, whichever is later.</p>
<p>In the aggregate positions can increase and decrease as in a traditional DRP system.  Aggregations can
be at the part, supply pool, facility level or any combination thereof.</p>
<p>If the availability date for a demand is greater than the <em>current promise date</em>, there is a shortage.  This shortage
may be actionable</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Expedite the purchase order</p></li>
<li><p>Relieve other supply to satisfy this demand by changing its supply pool</p></li>
<li><p>Create a new requisition</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If the earliest demand date for a supply falls in a later bucket than the supply availability this may be actionable:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Reschedule the Purchase Order or Work Order</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Consideration must be made to eliminate <em>nervouos</em> adjustments, those for a short time period or for dollar amounts
such that de-expediting costs exceed the time value of the early receipt</p>
<p>In traditional DRP the additional replenishment is an Economic Order Quantity <em>EOQ</em></p>
<p>This is not applicable to aerospace due to the unit price sensitivity to order quantity.</p>
<p>You probably know what an <em>EOQ</em>, if not a quick refresher is just a <em>google</em> or <em>duckduckgo</em> search away.</p>
<p>This model also fails to take into consideration a myriad of constraints which may
make a given supply ineligible for a given demand.  This is a model for SKU inventory,
not for engineered parts.</p>
<p>Note that orders and forecast are both demands but are not aggregated, orders <em>consume
the forecast</em>.</p>

</div>
<div class="section" id="shortages">
<h2>Shortages<a class="headerlink" href="#shortages" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Diamond APS classifies shortages into the following categories</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Unallocated Customer Orders</p></li>
<li><p>Unallocated Work Orders</p></li>
<li><p>Unallocated Safety Stock</p></li>
<li><p>Unallocated Forecasts</p></li>
<li><p>Customers Orders allocated beyond the requested date</p></li>
<li><p>Work Orders allocated beyond the requested date</p></li>
<li><p>Safety Stock allocated beyond the requested date</p></li>
<li><p>Forecasts allocated beyond the requested date</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Users can choose a combination of any of these shortage conditions and
then apply the following filters to narrow their search</p>
<p>Part Number Mask (A wildcard search for a range of Part Numbers)</p>
<p>The Part Category. Normally buyers are responsible for purchasing a
certain category or categories of parts. This help narrow the results to
only the parts they are responsible for purchasing.</p>
<p>Within Lead Time.  This restricts the output only to shortages that occur within the lead
time for a given</p>
<p>Part Outstanding Vendor Quotes less than “X” days. This
further narrows the search and ignores the parts that have outstanding
vendor quotes that are less than “X” days old. Vendors normally take
some time to respond to quotes and this help buyers from seeing the same
parts on the list even after they have worked on it.</p>
<p>Planning Horizon End Date. This restricts the list of parts being shown to have shortages
only within the Date specified here Buyer. This only shows the parts the
specified buyer is responsible for buying.</p>
<p>Customer Code. This restricts the list of parts only to the shortages for the customer specified.
Maximum Part to display. The default is set to 100. The users can specify any number greater than 0.</p>
<p>Once the search criteria is specified, APS will go through its planning
results and find all the part numbers that match the specified search
criteria. It will then sort them into 4 groups.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Unallocated or Late Customer Orders</p></li>
<li><p>Unallocated or Late Work Orders</p></li>
<li><p>Unallocated or Late Safety Stock</p></li>
<li><p>Unallocated or Late Forecasts</p></li>
</ul>
<p>A Part will only appear in one of these groups, the group in which the
part has the earliest shortage. Each part then links off into a 12-month
time-phased view of the Demand and Supply outlook. The time-phased
output has columns for past due, current, 12 months starting with the
current month and a column for demands and supplies coming in beyond 12
months. This page also provides links to see the following information
