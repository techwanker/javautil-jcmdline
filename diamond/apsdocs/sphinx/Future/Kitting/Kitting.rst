Business Process Improvement : Kitting
======================================

Created by James Schmidt, last modified on Dec 21, 2019

Ken Laver, on the board of Messier-Dowty approached Doug Woooling of
Interfast to create kits for the following reasons

-  Better Planning

-  Lower Cost

-  Higher accuracy

Messier Dowty was using SAP while Interfast was using DIamond

Project Initiatition
--------------------

Jim Schmidt met with Clive Priggen, warehouse manager at Interfast and
developed functional requirements

Custom Labels

Tackle Box

Description
-----------

Each KIt would get a defined *tackle box*

Custom Labels for tackle boxes would be defined

Each tackle box would have an inner bag

Inner bags would have custom labels

Modifications
-------------

Planning
~~~~~~~~

Some Components could not split accross lots

Expiration date on parts

New supply type created, work orders

Bills of Materials defined

Buyback inventory

Allocaton Based Pricing

Warehouse Operations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Process

Customer defined forecast

Tackle box needs forecasted

Parts were moved from within the warehouse to the kitting area, to
warehouse personnel, this was simply another directed move controlled by
handheld bar scannners

Got to bin

place in tote repeat until tote done

move tote to staging area or splitting location

split if necessary

Other notes

Each movement is logged

KIt assembly find a part

Place appropriate number in each kit with scan

Close tackle boxes or bulk close

Results
-------

This was so much more efficient than using SAP that many more kitting
operations were provided

Addittional Customers

Benefits
--------

Interfast got fees for kitting operations

Interfast sold the other parts needed for the kits

Further usage
-------------

Other notes

Each step was a micro-transaction as a s stored procedure
