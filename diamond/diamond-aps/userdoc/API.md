# Advanced Planning Service  - Application Program Interface

## Introduction

Three types of data are required

#1 Control Data

#. Planning Group Data

#. Bills of Material

## Control Data

Control Data is generally very static and it is not necessary to provide with each 
planning group.

Control Data defines the overall environment such as facilities and which inventory
can be made available to the various demands.

### Supply Pool

A supply pool is a logical separation of inventory, allowing partitioning of inventory
to be made available for sets of demands and reserved for others.

The association of supply pools to demand is specified in *sourcing rules*
