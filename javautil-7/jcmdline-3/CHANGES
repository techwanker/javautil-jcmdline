Release 1.0.3
===============================================================================
Bugs Fixed:
Bug 1038722 - setOptions() and setArgs() in BasicCmdLineHandler throw 
              NullPointerExceptions when passed null as the parameter.
Bug 759800  - make StringParam.UNSPECIFIED_LENGTH public.

Other Changes:
    Added 'jar' target to the build.xml so that 'ant jar' will generate a
    jcmdline.jar file to the ./build directory for use by other projects that
    need to build from source.

    Deprecated the StringParam.setMaxLength() method in favor of setMaxValLen(),
    which is more in keeping with the naming of other methods in the class.

Release 1.0.2
===============================================================================
Bugs Fixed:

Bug 759797 - BasicCmdLineHandler parameters passed as Collection cause
             ClassCastException.

Release 1.0.1

This is the initial release of the jcmdline package.
