Relational mapping tool ....

\subsection{Mapping File}
Generally there is one mapping file and one Data Transfer Object (DTO) class per table or view.
The mapping file specifies the class to which the table will be mapped and associations between class members and database columns.
It also specifies imported and exported foreign keys.



A session managed bean is a simple java bean with some ``magic glue'' that associates the bean with a row in a table.
Updates to the bean can be reflected in the database with minimal coding, far less work than it would take to do the same thing in 
standard JDBC or even PL/SQL.
