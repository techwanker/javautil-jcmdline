I'd like an 8'  2 X 4

A) What's a 2 X 4?
B) Here's a picture of one.
C) Here, I've been sanding this 1 X 3 for a couple of hours, it will soon be a 2 X 4.
D) No, you want a 1 3/4 X 2 1/2, I have one 7'8" standard height and I have a 10' ready to cut down.
E) I will grow a tree and nuture it.
F) Too busy to deal with your request.
G) Hardwood or Softwood, green or cured?  Clear or Knotty?  (Call in 5 minutes) Sanded?  (call in 2 minutes) how long will you be needing it?
What are you going to do with it?
H) I grew a forest, 3 kinds of trees, cut them down and made a saw mill, made a bunch of 2x4s. I have no idea where they are
I) I have a funny story about 2x4s.  (It wasn't funny)
j) I have created an extensible 2x4 with variability in all dimensions, all you have to do is pull (crack!!!) ... I'll show you in 15 minutes
