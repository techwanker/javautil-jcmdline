\section{Creating a user}


if I am not going to allow somebody to connect, what does the password mean?

create user &&username identified by &&password;


alter user &&username default tablespace users;

alter user &&username quota unlimited on users;

grant create table to &&username;

grant create session to &&username;

grant create sequence to &&username;

grant create view to &&username;

grant alter session to &&username;

\subsection{Data Owner}

So, should the schema owner have connect priviliges?
