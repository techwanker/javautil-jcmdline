# Vending Sales Reporting

Showcase for javautil.

This is a trivial but real world example.

Pacific Data Services is offering a free audit for manufacturers
utilizing Custom Data Solutions for rebate processing.


## Audit reports include:

*  Misclassified Items
*  Erroneous rebate amount
*  Incorrect Operator Mailing address
*  Suspect Quantities
*  Missing Product Opportunities
*  Invalid rebate amounts

## Features:
   Completely Open Source
   Databases:
   
   * Postgresql
   * H2
      
   Oracle is also supported, but it is certainly not open source

## Functionality

This application will: 

* Parse Sales Reporting data in a real world format (used by vending machine operators)

* Persist the reported data into a database

* Perform quality checks on the data

* Prepost the data by resolving products, etc. 

* Post valid data






* Validate customer addresses

* Create Excel workbooks

* Compute rebates and create ACH transactions to send to the vendors for rebates
