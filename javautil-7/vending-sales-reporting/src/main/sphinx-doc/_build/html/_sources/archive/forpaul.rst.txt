For Paul
========

The data format is specified below.

The source of the data is the distributors, they already provide this data and we can read the existing files reported.

The target is the manufacturer, that would gain access to all of the distributors.

Missing sales opportunities allows the manufacturer and the distributor sell additional products.

Who installs?

This is a hosted service, nothing has to be installed by the manufacturer or distributor.

FL sells the chips to distributors who sell to vending machine operators, retail stores, schools, sporting concessions, hotel chains, etc.

It doesn't matter who the distributor sells it to, it is just a customer and a customer type from our perspective.

The persons at Pepsi and Frito-Lay who are currently in charge of the rebate programs.

Rebate programs are custom and quarterly, with rebates based on growth or growth of certain products.

I presume the function of the contact at FL and Frito is the same as Don Lear at Hershey.

Please look at the custdata.com website for a list of manufacturers being processed, there are many.
