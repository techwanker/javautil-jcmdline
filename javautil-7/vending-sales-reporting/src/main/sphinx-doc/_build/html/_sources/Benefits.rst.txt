Frito-Lay Pepsi
---------------

Audit
*****
Identify product miscategorization.  Product GTINS may be "guessed" from the product description,
this is error prone.

ACH rebate payments
*******************
Rather than mail out checks, ACH transactions can be made, Pepsico-Frito can review and forward to  
its bank and rebate payments can be sent out electronically for about $0.01 per transaction.

This is faster, less expensive and less error prone than mailing out checks and more convenient for
the distributors.

Anomolies
*********
Report outliers on data reporting.

This is performed by the *javautil.org* *Condition Identification* package, written by
Jim Schmidt for use by Trinity Technical Services customers to identify potential problems
with data loading into the data warehouse.

Jim Schmidt demonstrated this while building an entire rebate program for a Custom Data Solutions
client and it was used to replace the paper reporting system, saving a huge amount of time and increasing
the identification of suspect data using metrics derived from historical data.  This was completely 
designed and written by Jim Schmidt prior to joining CDS.
