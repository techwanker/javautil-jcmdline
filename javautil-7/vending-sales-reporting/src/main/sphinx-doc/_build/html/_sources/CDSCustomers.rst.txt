Business Process
----------------
Manufacturers who distribute their product through specialty channels:

* Vending Machine Operators
* Fund Raising (Hershey)
* Concession (Hershey)

Have their distributors report sales in the format described elsewhere.

Processing Steps
----------------

Data is uploaded to the data processing service.

The file loads are analyzed at CDS using an old version of my javautil conditionidentification package.

The data is loading into prepost tables.

The data is posted

A snapshot of the data is made once a day for online web reporting in the form of spreadsheets.

Rebate programs are designed and the sales are tracked and the rebates calculated.

Rebate checks are mailed out.
