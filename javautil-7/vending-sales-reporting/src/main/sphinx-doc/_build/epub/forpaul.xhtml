<h1>For Paul</h1>
<p>The data format is specified below.</p>
<p>The source of the data is the distributors, they already provide this data and we can read the existing files reported.</p>
<p>The target is the manufacturer, that would gain access to all of the distributors.</p>
<p>Missing sales opportunities allows the manufacturer and the distributor sell additional products.</p>
<p>Who installs?</p>
<p>This is a hosted service, nothing has to be installed by the manufacturer or distributor.</p>
<p>FL sells the chips to distributors who sell to vending machine operators, retail stores, schools, sporting concessions, hotel chains, etc.</p>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t matter who the distributor sells it to, it is just a customer and a customer type from our perspective.</p>
<p>The persons at Pepsi and Frito-Lay who are currently in charge of the rebate programs.</p>
<p>Rebate programs are custom and quarterly, with rebates based on growth or growth of certain products.</p>
<p>I presume the function of the contact at FL and Frito is the same as Don Lear at Hershey.</p>
<p>Please look at the custdata.com website for a list of manufacturers being processed, there are many.</p>
