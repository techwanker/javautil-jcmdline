History of Jim Schmidt and Custom Data Solutions
================================================

Creation
--------

Custom Data Solutions was initially called CDS for Chuck and Dee Schmidt.

Chuck is my older brother and Dee is his wife.

Chuck left his job at Michigan National Bank to offer data processing services, initially using a TRS-80 to print mailing labels.

He subsequently bought an Alpha Micro http://www.s100computers.com/Hardware%20Folder/Alpha%20Micro/History/History.htm and wrote some business applications.

On a visit to Detroit I explained to him the benefits of Unix and got him started, installing Interactive Unix from Kodak on a PC from 133 floppy disks in 1990.

Between 1983 and 1990 I worked as Vice President of International Banking Systems for RepublicBank Dallas, as a principal at a Distribution Requirements Planning Company and then at Computer Associates where I single handedly designed and wrote the ACH settlement software system in six weeks.

In 1990 I started Trinity Technical Services with two partners and ended up buying them both out.

My first contract was the selection of an ERP system for a distributor in Texas.  The chosen vendor was CIM-JIT and it was my first exposure to Oracle. I soon
became more proficient in the CIM-JIT software than the vendor and flew around 
country to modify to delivered software to comply with commitments to customers.

In the process I became quite proficient in fixing performance problems.

Convinced that Oracle was the finest relational database, I convinced Chuck to
come down to my Dallas office for a quick introduction.

He immediately saw the benefits of SQL over procedural file manipulation and 
also became an Oracle Partner.


CDS somehow happened to land a contract to handle rebates for Leaf Gum.

Relationship
************

Custom Data Services was created by my brother Chuck.  I consulted to them for over 25 years and
taught him everything he knew from linux to relational databases, website creation, c and java.

In 2007 I accepted the position of CIO when my brother sold the company.  I gave up my consulting practice
on the promise that I could work remotely after my son went to college.

After I completely revised all of the infrastructure, which was horrible in more ways than can be credibly described
including the fact that they were seven years out of date on Oracle and had 14 instances running on three different 
machines, I upgraded to Oracle 10 and migrated everything to one instance and finally into one schema.

After I sold my house and all my possessions and moved to Costa Rica, they fired me.

They stole my javautil code, there was a lawsuit, but I would have had to have their current employees testify that
the code they were using was in production at my customer sites before I joined CDS.

A settlement was reached, I allowed them to continue to use the code while retaining all rights.

Business Process
----------------
Manufacturers who distribute their product through specialty channels:

* Vending Machine Operators
* Fund Raising (Hershey)
* Concession (Hershey)

Have their distributors report sales in the format described elsewhere.

Processing Steps
----------------

Data is uploaded to the data processing service.

The file loads are analyzed at CDS using an old version of my javautil conditionidentification package.

The data is loading into prepost tables.

The data is posted

A snapshot of the data is made once a day for online web reporting in the form of spreadsheets.

Rebate programs are designed and the sales are tracked and the rebates calculated.

Rebate checks are mailed out.
